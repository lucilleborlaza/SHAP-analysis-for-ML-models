## SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for Ozone pollution analysis 
This repository is for performing several machine learning techniques to determine the influence of PMF-resolved VOC sources on ozone pollution in an urban site in Bronx, New York City. The model that showed best performance was XGBoost, compared to Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees models. All data was acquired from USEPA AirNow. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approach was utilized to explain and visualize the output of the machine learning models.
